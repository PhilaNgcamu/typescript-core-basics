TypeScript allows you to create type aliases when you declare a name for any type.
This is an ALTERNATIVE for using object types and union types with type annotations.

- Note: **Type Aliases** are convenient if you want to reuse the type in many functions.

- The type alias, "Point" is an equivalent to an object type with x & y propeties. Reference: **typeAliases.ts**

- Note: Use "**tsc --target es2021 <-- fileName -->**" to compile the ts file
