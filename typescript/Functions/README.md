Functions allow data to be manipulated by passing them as parameters which can be inferred to specific types.

- You can annote the parameter with a type but it's not needed as Typescipt assumes any type value as any. Reference: **parameterTypeAnnotations.ts**

- Note: Use "**tsc --target es2021 <-- fileName -->**" to compile the ts file
