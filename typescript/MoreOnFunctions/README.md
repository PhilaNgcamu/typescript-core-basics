<h1>Functions</h1>

Functions allow data to be manipulated by passing them as parameters which can be inferred to specific types and also the type of output of the value.

- You can annote the parameter with a type but it's not needed as Typescipt assumes any type value as any. Reference: [parameterTypeAnnotations.ts](parameterTypeAnnotations.ts)

- You can annote the function with a return type but it's not needed as Typescipt assumes any type value as any. Reference: **returnTypeAnnotations.ts**

- Anonymous functions are declared without a variable, typically they may be callback functions in some cases. Reference: **anonymousFunctions.ts**

- NOTE: Use "**tsc --target es2021 <-- fileName -->**" to compile the ts file
