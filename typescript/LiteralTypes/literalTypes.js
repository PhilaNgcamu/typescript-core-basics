let changingString = "Hello, World"; // where the type of "changingString" is string for any possible string due to "let"
changingString;
const constantString = "Hello, World"; // where the type of "constantString" is "Hello, World" ONLY! beacuse of "const"(you cannot reassign the variable)
let x = "hello"; //where "hello" is the literal string to be assigned to x (the only possible)
//The following is an error becuse x is the literal type of "hello" only:
//x = "World";
