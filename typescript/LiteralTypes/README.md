<h1>Literal Types</h1>

- **Literal types** are "specific" strings and numbers types.

- `let changingString = "Hello World`, where TypeScript interpretes it as `let changingString: string` for any possible string. Reference: [literalTypes.ts](literalTypes.ts)

- `const constantString = "Hello World`, where TypeScript interpretes it as `const constantString: Hello World`, where `Hello World` is a literal type that is not changed. Reference: [literalTypes.ts](literalTypes.ts)
